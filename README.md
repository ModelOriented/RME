Recurrent Memory Explainer (RME) is a tool for creating interpretable explanations, dedicated to models operating on sequential data. RME focuses on the memory of a sequential model and tries to explain the decision by pointing important places in the sequence that had an effect on the prediction. RME is based on so-called „memory profiles”, which are intuitive and can be easily visualised on simple plot charts.
